- Study [methodology](https://www.science.org/content/article/about-these-data?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D47656180226673402683555563101738189823%7CMCORGID%3D242B6472541199F70A4C98A6%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1676298737&_ga=2.2514611.247686987.1676298736-1493408718.1676298736).

> Then, in 2009, the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE), a nonprofit group in Eastleigh, U.K., that now advises more than 12,000 journal editors and publishers, released [a model policy](https://publicationethics.org/files/retraction%20guidelines_0.pdf) for how journals should handle retractions.

- Link to policy is broken
- In searching on COPE page, I found this: <https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines> and a DOI to this <https://doi.org/10.24318/cope.2019.1.4>

>Behaviors widely understood within science to be dishonest and unethical, but which fall outside the U.S. misconduct definition, seem to account for another 10%. Those behaviors include forged authorship, fake peer reviews, and failure to obtain approval from institutional review boards for research on human subjects or animals. (Such retractions have increased as a share of all retractions, and some experts argue the United States should expand its definition of scientific misconduct to cover those behaviors.)
