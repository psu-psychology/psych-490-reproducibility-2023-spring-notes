A humorous perspective (NYU Health Sciences Library 2013) Feynmann on ‘Cargo Cult Science’ Richard Feynman Figure 1.8: Richard P. Feynman, Wikipedia Who was he? Figure 1.9: (Feynman 1974) What does Feynman mean by ‘Cargo Cult Science’? I think the educational and psychological studies I mentioned are examples of what I would like to call Cargo Cult Science. In the South Seas there is a Cargo Cult of people. During the war they saw airplanes land with lots of good materials, and they want the same thing to happen now. So they’ve arranged to make things like runways, to put fires along the sides of the runways, to make a wooden hut for a man to sit in, with two wooden pieces on his head like headphones and bars of bamboo sticking out like antennas—he’s the controller—and they wait for the airplanes to land. They’re doing everything right. The form is perfect. It looks exactly the way it looked before. But it doesn’t work. No airplanes land. So I call these things Cargo Cult Science, because they follow all the apparent precepts and forms of scientific investigation, but they’re missing something essential, because the planes don’t land. More about “cargo cults”: (rjlipton 2023) Implicit rules (practices or norms) in science …That is the idea that we all hope you have learned in studying science in school—we never explicitly say what this is, but just hope that you catch on by all the examples of scientific investigation. It is interesting, therefore, to bring it out now and speak of it explicitly. It’s a kind of scientific integrity, a principle of scientific thought that corresponds to a kind of utter honesty—a kind of leaning over backwards. For example, if you’re doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid—not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you’ve eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked—to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated. Principle 1: Don’t fool yourself The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool. So you have to be very careful about that. After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists. You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that. Principle 2: Show how your maybe wrong I’m talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending over backwards to show how you’re maybe wrong, that you ought to do when acting as a scientist. And this is our responsibility as scientists, certainly to other scientists, and I think to laymen. Principle 3: Publish your results whichever way they come out One example of the principle is this: If you’ve made up your mind to test a theory, or you want to explain some idea, you should always decide to publish it whichever way it comes out. If we only publish results of a certain kind, we can make the argument look good. We must publish both kinds of result. Figure 1.10: (Oreskes 2019) Flaws in how science is actually practiced Other kinds of errors are more characteristic of poor science. When I was at Cornell. I often talked to the people in the psychology department. One of the students told me she wanted to do an experiment that went something like this—I don’t remember it in detail, but it had been found by others that under certain circumstances, X, rats did something, A. She was curious as to whether, if she changed the circumstances to Y, they would still do, A. So her proposal was to do the experiment under circumstances Y and see if they still did A. I explained to her that it was necessary first to repeat in her laboratory the experiment of the other person—to do it under condition X to see if she could also get result A—and then change to Y and see if A changed. Then she would know that the real difference was the thing she thought she had under control. She was very delighted with this new idea, and went to her professor. And his reply was, no, you cannot do that, because the experiment has already been done and you would be wasting time. This was in about 1935 or so, and it seems to have been the general policy then to not try to repeat psychological experiments, but only to change the conditions and see what happens. Principle 4: Replicate then extend. Principle 5: Scientific integrity requires a form of freedom …So I have just one wish for you—the good luck to be somewhere where you are free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that freedom. Questions to ponder Do you agree or disagree with Feynman’s characterizations of poor science? Why or why not? What are Feynman’s ‘rules’ or principles? Are these ‘rules’ or principles taught explicitly? Where and how? If not, why not? Do you agree or disagree that these rules are essential for scientific integrity? Why does Feynman suggest that you, the scientist or student, are the easiest one to fool?

Exercise 01: Norms and counter-norms Begley’s ‘Bombshell’ Reading: (Harris 2017), Chapter 1. Figure 1.11: (Harris 2017) Background C. Glenn Begley (Begley and Ellis 2012) The scientific community assumes that the claims in a preclinical study can be taken at face value — that although there might be some errors in detail, the main message of the paper can be relied on and the data will, for the most part, stand the test of time. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. Over the past decade, before pursuing a particular line of research, scientists (including C.G.B.) in the haematology and oncology department at the biotechnology firm Amgen in Thousand Oaks, California, tried to confirm published findings related to that work. Fifty-three papers were deemed ‘landmark’ studies (see ‘Reproducibility of research findings’). It was acknowledged from the outset that some of the data might not hold up, because papers were deliberately selected that described something completely new, such as fresh approaches to targeting cancers or alternative clinical uses for existing therapeutics. Nevertheless, scientific findings were confirmed in only 6 (11%) cases. Even knowing the limitations of preclinical research, this was a shocking result. Journal Impact Factor \\(n\\) articles Mean number of citations for non-reproduced articles Mean number of citations of reproduced articles &gt;20 21 248 [3, 800] 231 [82-519] 5-19 32 168 [6, 1,909] 13 [3, 24] Table 1 from (Begley and Ellis 2012) Findings Findings of 6/53 published papers (11%) could be reproduced Original authors often could not reproduce their own work Earlier paper (Prinz, Schlange, and Asadullah 2011) had also found low rate of reproducibility. Paper titled “Believe it or not: How much can we rely on published data on potential drug targets?” Figure 1 from (Prinz, Schlange, and Asadullah 2011) We received input from 23 scientists (heads of laboratories) and collected data from 67 projects, most of them (47) from the field of oncology. This analysis revealed that only in ∼20–25% of the projects were the relevant published data completely in line with our in-house findings (Prinz, Schlange, and Asadullah 2011) Published papers (that can’t be reproduced) are cited hundreds or thousands of times Cost of irreproducible research estimated in billions of dollars (Freedman, Cockburn, and Simcoe 2015). An analysis of past studies indicates that the cumulative (total) prevalence of irreproducible preclinical research exceeds 50%, resulting in approximately US$28,000,000,000 (US$28B)/year spent on preclinical research that is not reproducible—in the United States alone. (Freedman, Cockburn, and Simcoe 2015). Figure 2 from (Freedman, Cockburn, and Simcoe 2015) Information about U.S. Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Expenditures from the Congressional Research Service. - Note that business accounts for 2-3x+ the Government’s share of R&amp;D expenditures. Questions to ponder Why does Harris call this a ‘bombshell’? Do you agree that it has/had or should have an ‘explosive’ impact? Why? Why do Begley &amp; Ellis focus on a journal’s impact factor? Why do Begley &amp; Ellis focus on citations to reproduced vs. non-reproduced articles? Why should non-scientists care? Why should scientists in other fields (not cancer biology) care?

But you might get inspired and decide to focus your final project around the topic. “What I’m alleging is that the reviewers, the editors of the so-called top-tier journals, grant review committees, promotion committees, and the scientific community repeatedly tolerate poor-quality science.” – C.

Because scientists focus so much on trying to persuade their peers, which is the way they get those studies through peer review and oward to publication, it’s all too easy for them to disregard the real object of science: getting us closer to the truth.

We outline a path that moves away from the existing model of scientific communication to improve the efficiency in meeting the purpose of public science—knowledge accumulation. We call for six changes: (a) full embrace of digital communication; (b) open access to all published research; (c) disentangling publication from evaluation; (d) breaking the “one article, one journal” model with a grading system for evaluation and diversified dissemination outlets; (e) publishing peer review; and (f) allowing open, continuous peer review. We address conceptual and practical barriers to change and provide examples showing how the suggested practices are being used already. The critical barriers to change are not technical or financial; they are social. Although scientists guard the status quo, they also have the power to change it.

Discuss (Merton 1973) Note: Merton 1973 PDF on Canvas Difficult as the notion may appear to those reared in a culture that grants science a prominent if not a commanding place in the scheme of things, it is evident that science is not immune from attack, restraint, and repression. Writing a little while ago, Veblen could observe that the faith of western culture in science was unbounded, unquestioned, unrivaled. The revolt from science which then appeared so improbable as to concern only the timid academician who would ponder all contingencies, however remote, has now been forced upon the attention of scientist and layman alike. Local contagions of anti-intellectualism threaten to become epidemic. – (Merton 1973), p. 267 Science is a deceptively inclusive word which refers to a variety of distinct though interrelated items. It is commonly used to denote (1) a set of characteristic methods by means of which knowledge is certified; (2) a stock of accumulated knowledge stemming from the application of these methods; (3) a set of cultural values and mores governing the activities termed scientific; or (4) any combination of the foregoing. – (Merton 1973), p. 268 The ethos of science The mores of science possess a methodologic rationale ut they are binding, not only because they are procedurally efficient, but because they are believed right and good. – (Merton 1973), p. 270 Universalism See paragraph at top of p. 271 for context about the following: Yet this very deviation from the norm of universalism actually presupposed the the legitimacy of the norm. For nationalistic bias is oppropbrious only if judged in terms of the standard of universalism; within another institutional context, it is redefined as a virtue patriotism. Thus, in the process of condemning their violation, the mores are reaffirmed. – (Merton 1973), p. 271 To restrict scientific careers on grounds other than lack of competence is to prejudice the furtherance of knowledge. – (Merton 1973), p. 272 “Communism” “Communism” in the nontechnical and extended sense of common ownership of goods…The substantive findings of science are a product of a social collaboration and are assigned to the community…Property rights in sciences are whittled down to a bare minimum by the rationale of the scientific ethic. – (Merton 1973), p. 273 The institutional conception of science as part of the public domain is linked with the imperative for communication of scientific findings. Secrecy is the antithesis of this norm; full and open communication is its enactment. – (Merton 1973), p. 274 Henry Cavendish was known for not publishing much of his work. Disinterestedness disinterested The virtual absence of fraud in the annals of science, which appears exceptional when compared with the record of other spheres of activity, has at times been attributed to the personal qualities of scientists…There is, in fact, no satisfactory evidence that such is the case; a more plausible explanation may be found in certain characteristcs of science itself…the activities of scientists are subject to rigorous policing, to a degree perhaps unparalleled in any other field of activity. – (Merton 1973), p. 276 It is probable that the reputability of science and its lofty ethical status in the estimate of the layman is in no small measure due to technological achievements…the laity is often in no position to distinguish spurious from genuine claims…The presumably scientific pronouncements of totalitarian spokensmen are for the uninstructed laity of the same order as newspaper reports on an expanding universe or wave mechanics. – (Merton 1973), p. 277 Organized Skepticism …is variously interrelated with other elements of the scientific ethos. It is both a methodological and institutional mandate. – (Merton 1973), p. 277 The scientific investigator does not preserve the cleavage between the sacred and the profane, between that which requires uncritical respect and that which can be objectively analyzed. – (Merton 1973), p. 277-278 Discuss (Mitroff 1974) …the personal character of science infuses its entire structure. The testing and validating of scientific ideas is as governed by the deep personal character of science as the initial discovery of the ideas…Polyani (1958) argues that not only is this the case, but it ought to be the case. That is, science outght to be personal to its core. – (Mitroff 1974), p. 580 …what the body of scientists thought about their fellow scientists. Who were perceived as most committed to their pet hypotheses? What did they think of such behavior? What did the scientists think of the abstract idea of commitment [to a pet hypothesis] itself… – (Mitroff 1974), p. 582 All the interviews exhibit high affective content. They document the often fierce, sometimes bitter, competitive races for discovery and the intense emotions which permeate the doing of science. – (Mitroff 1974), p. 585 The term “commitment” was used in three distinct (but related) senses. The first expresssed the notion of intellectual commitment, that is that scientific observerations were theory-laden…The second sense expressed the notion of affective commitment…The third sense expressed the notion that the entire process of science demanded deep personal commitment. – (Mitroff 1974), p. 586 Table 4: A Tentative List of Norms and Counternorms Norms Counternorms 1. Faith in the moral virtue of rationality (Barber, 1952). 1. Faith in the moral virtue of rationality and nonrationality (cf., Tart, 1972). 2. Emotional neutrality as an instru­ mental condition for the achieve­ ment of rationality (Barber, 1952). 2. Emotional commitment as an instrumental condition for the achievement of rationality. 3. Universalism: “The acceptance or rejection of claims entering the list of science is not to depend on the personal or social attri­ butes of their protagonist; his race, nationality, religion, class and personal qualities are as such irrelevant. Objectivity precludes particularism …. The imperative of universalism is rooted deep in the impersonal character of science” (Merton, 1949:607). 3. Particularism: “The acceptance or rejection of claims entering the list of science is to a large extent a function of who makes the claim” (Boguslaw, 1968:59). The social and psychological characteristics of the scientist are important factors influencing how his work will be judged. The work of certain scientists will be given priority over that of others (Mitroff, 1974b). The imperative of particularism is rooted deep in the personal character of science (Merton, 1963a; Polanyi, 1958). 4. Communism: “Property rights are reduced to the absolute minimum of credit for priority of discovery” (Barber, 1952:130). “Secrecy is the antithesis’ of this norm; full and open communication [of scientific results] its enactment” (Merton, 1949:611). 4. Solitariness (or, “Miserism” [Boguslaw, 1968:59]): Property rights are expanded to include protective control over the disposition of one’s discoveries; secrecy thus becomes a necessary moral act (Mitroff, 1974b). 5. Disinterestedness: “Scientists are expected by their peers to achieve the self-interest they have in work–satisfaction and in prestige through serving the [scientific] community interest directly” (Barber, 1952:132). 5. Interestedness: Scientists are expected by their close colleagues to achieve the self-interest they have in work-satisfaction and in prestige through serving their special communities of interest, e.g., their invisible college (Boguslaw, 1968:59; Mitroff, 1974b) 6. Organized scepticism: “The scientist is obliged … to make public his criticisms of the work of others when he believes it to be in error … no scientist’s contribution to knowledge can be accepted without careful scrutiny, and that the scientist must doubt his own findjngs as well as those of others” (Storer, 1966: 79). 6. Organized dogmatism: “Each scientist should make certain that previous work by others on which he bases his work is sufficiently identified so that others can be held responsible for inadequacies while any possible credit accrues to oneself” (Boguslaw, 1968:59). The scientist must believe in his own findings with utter conviction while doubting those of others with all his worth (Mitroff, 1974b). Adapted from Table 4. (Mitroff 1974), p. 592.

You are not required to comment.&quot; These variable names are too long to be useful. Let’s look at the source publication (Kardash and Edwards 2012) to see if we can simplify them in a useful way. So, the Appendix labels each question with a short phrase and notes whether the concept is a norm (N) or counter-norm (CN). Let’s rename the variables using the single words. new_names &lt;- c( &quot;Timestamp&quot;, &quot;Disinterestedness&quot;, &quot;Organized Skepticism&quot;, &quot;Particularism&quot;, &quot;Communality&quot;, &quot;Organized Dogmatism&quot;, &quot;Self-interestedness&quot;, &quot;Universalism&quot;, &quot;Solitariness&quot;, &quot;Comments&quot; ) names(survey_01) &lt;- new_names These data are ‘wide’, meaning that there are multiple variables for each respondent. The data will be easier to visualize and analyze if we make the data ‘longer’. survey_01_long &lt;- survey_01 %&gt;% tidyr::pivot_longer(., !c(&#39;Timestamp&#39;, &#39;Comments&#39;), names_to = &quot;norm_counternorm&quot;, values_to = &quot;rating&quot;) We should indicate whether these are norms, and label them “N”, or counternorms, and label them “CN”. survey_01_long &lt;- survey_01_long %&gt;% dplyr::mutate(., type = if_else( norm_counternorm %in% c( &quot;Disinterestedness&quot;, &quot;Organized Skepticism&quot;, &quot;Communality&quot;, &quot;Universalism&quot; ), &quot;N&quot;, &quot;CN&quot; )) Finally, there is a “test” set of responses that I used to test this data processing workflow. We should delete those responses since they are nonsensical–I just hit random buttons to make some data. survey_01_long_clean &lt;- survey_01_long %&gt;% dplyr::filter(., is.na(Comments)) Visualize data Unique respondents There appear to be \\(n=\\) 8 respondents as of 2023-01-16 11:50:15 Rating distribution Remember, the rating scale was from 1: “not at all” to 5: “a great deal”. survey_01_long %&gt;% ggplot() + aes(norm_counternorm, rating, fill = type) + geom_violin() + coord_flip() References "],["references.html", "References", " References "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
