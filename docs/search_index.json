Background The survey questions were derived from the Appendix in (Kardash and Edwards 2012). We thank these authors for publishing the survey questions in their article so that we could reuse them for our class. Set-up We load the required R packages. Download data Download the data file from the spreadsheet generated by the Google Form into a comma-separated value (CSV) file in a local directory called csv/.

Examine the variable names. ## [1] &quot;Timestamp&quot; ## [2] &quot;Scientists are generally motivated by the desire for knowledge and discovery, and not by the possibility of personal gain.&quot; ## [3] &quot;Scientists make an attempt to consider all new evidence, hypotheses, theories, and innovations, even those that challenge or contradict their own work.&quot; ## [4] &quot;Scientists generally assess new knowledge and its applications based on the reputation and past productivity of the individual or research group.&quot; ## [5] &quot;Scientists openly share new findings with all colleagues.&quot; ## [6] &quot;Scientists generally invest their careers in promoting their own most important findings, theories, or innovations.&quot; ## [7] &quot;Scientists compete with others in the same field for funding and recognition of their achievements.&quot; ## [8] &quot;Scientists generally evaluate research only on its merit (i.e., according to accepted standards of the field).&quot; ## [9] &quot;Scientists emphasize the protection of their newest findings to ensure priority in publishing, patenting, or applications.&quot; ## [10] &quot;If you wish to comment about the questions in this survey, you may do so here. You are not required to comment.&quot; These variable names are too long to be useful. Let’s look at the source publication (Kardash and Edwards 2012) to see if we can simplify them in a useful way. So, the Appendix labels each question with a short phrase and notes whether the concept is a norm (N) or counter-norm (CN). Let’s rename the variables using the single words. These data are ‘wide’, meaning that there are multiple variables for each respondent. The data will be easier to visualize and analyze if we make the data ‘longer’. Finally, there is a “test” set of responses that I used to test this data processing workflow. We should delete those responses since they are nonsensical–I just hit random buttons to make some data.
